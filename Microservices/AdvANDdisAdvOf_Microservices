Advantages of microservices:
The cost of scaling is comparatively less than the monolithic architecture.
Larger applications can remain mostly unaffected by the failure of a single module.
We can create one microservice in one stack and other using some other stack and deploy them.
Smaller and faster deployments

Disadvantages:
MAnaging distributes transactions
Deciding the context of the microservice. Which functionality to include and which to exclude from microservice.
When 1 service calls another service then there can be latency issues.
Testing microservices is always challenging.
