Things I have done on cloud:

Upload Http request to storage account container using BlobClient.
Using KeyVault in Spring Application
Sending/Receiving messages from service bus queue
Published Custom metrics(order count per wholesaler) to AzureDashboard. (actuator automatically publishes metrics to customMetrics table in workspace and then I created a KQL and then pin it to azure dashboard).
Created Alert email whenever there is an ERROR/Exception in app service logs. (created diagnostic setting to publish logs to AppServiceConsoleLog table and then create an alert rule from Log workspace).
Configured VM with SonarQube on it. And then added it to Azure Devops pipeline and everytime a build is generated, a sonar qube creates a report that can be viewed in azure ashboard.
Configured Application Gateway with WAF on it.
